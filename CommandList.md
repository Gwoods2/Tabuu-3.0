# Full list of commands:

This here contains every command with a detailed explanation on how to use them. They are ordered alphabetically, search them with Ctrl+F.  

### Quick explanation of the columns:
Arguments that are optional all have the `:Optional` suffix. Every other argument is required.  
The `Admin` column shows you whether a command needs Moderator Permissions: `âœ“`, Owner Permissions: `â—‹`, or everyone can use it: `âœ—`.  
The `Slash` column shows you whether or not a Slash Command / Application Command Version of this Command is available. If yes `âœ“`, you can use both the Normal and Slash version, if not `âœ—`, only the Text-based Command is available.  
The `Aliases` column shows you other names the Command is available from. The usage is exactly the same, if you use the default name or one of the listed aliases.  
Everything else should be self-explanatory.
